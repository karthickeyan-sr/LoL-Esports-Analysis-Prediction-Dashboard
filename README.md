League of Legends Esports Analysis: A Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis Approach to Predict Pre-Match Winners:

This is a League of Legends Esports game winner prediction dashboard developed using the XGBoost model, after implementing sentiment analysis and comparing nine machine learning models, to forecast pre-match winners using Python and various data analysis techniques. This is my MSc Data Science dissertation project at the University of Birmgham.

League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game played by millions of players worldwide. Predicting the outcome of esports matches is essential for developing team strategy, esports betting and much more. In this study, we test nine machine learning models and tune their hyperparameters using methods like Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimisation. We also introduce a new way to select essential features using mutual importance and CatBoost scores. We perform sentiment analysis on Reddit post comments and incorporate these sentiment scores into our models for predicting match outcomes. By doing this, we evaluate the potential of including public sentiment in predictive analytics. Furthermore, we have developed an interactive dashboard that predicts the winner based on the trained best model and provides valuable visual insights into team performance, which helps the stakeholders and esports organisations strategise and make informed decisions.

I want to express gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Mubashir Ali, as well as project supervisors Dr. JizhengWan and Dr. Qamar Natsheh, for their constant support during this project. Iâ€™m also grateful to my family and friends for always being there for me. I would also like to thank the University of Birmingham for providing me the sufficient resources and guidance to complete this project.
