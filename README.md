# LoL-Esports-Analysis-Prediction-Dashboard
This is a League of Legends Esports game winner prediction dashboard developed using the XGBoost model, after implementing sentiment analysis and comparing nine machine learning models, to forecast pre-match winners using Python and various data analysis techniques. This is my MSc Data Science dissertation project at the University of Birmgham.
